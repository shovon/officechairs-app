MDF and particle board are used in quality furniture for areas that need to be stable, such as large surfaces. These durable wood products do not expand and contract with heat and cold and do not absorb moisture as much as solid wood, which results in stronger and longer lasting furniture. Due to a wide variety of wood species and decorative designs used in our furniture styles, variations in construction are possible.Finishes: Hooker Furniture utilizes a multiple step finish process of up to 16 finish steps. This results in an unsurpassed clarity, depth and color richness and durability to their finishes. Through hand craftsmanship such as rubbing and padding, their finishes ''feel'' as good as they look, with a smoothness that is delightful to the touch.
